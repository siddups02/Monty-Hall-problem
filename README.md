# Monty-Hall-problem
Solved Monty Hall problem:

Monty Hall was a popular game show host on American television. In one segment of his show, you are a contestant from the studio audience. He shows you three doors, Door #1, Door #2, and Door #3. Hidden behind one door is a new car, and behind each of the other two doors is a goat.

Monty asks you to pick a door. Of course, you want to pick the right door and win the car. Being the host, Monty knows which door hides the car. After youâ€™ve picked a door, he opens one of the other doors and shows you a goat.

Monty then offers you a chance to stay with the door you originally picked, or you can switch your choice to the remaining third door. Would staying or switching be better?
